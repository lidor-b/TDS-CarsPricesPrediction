# TDS-CarsPricesPrediction

This repository contains code for developing a regression model to predict car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and other specifications.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an accurate model for predicting used car prices. This can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in the automotive market, as well as for insurance companies and financial institutions.

## Dataset

The dataset (`data/Car details.csv`) includes information about various cars, including:
- Make and Model
- Year of manufacture
- Mileage (Kilometer)
- Fuel Type
- Transmission
- Engine specifications
- And more...


## Future Work

- Experiment with other regression algorithms
- Perform more advanced feature engineering
- Optimize model hyperparameters
